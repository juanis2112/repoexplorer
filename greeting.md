# Welcome

Use this chat to explore the **University Repositories** dataset with natural-language questions.  
I’ll translate your request into filters/SQL and show the results.

## Good ways to ask

- Be specific about **university**, **project type**, **language**, **license**, and/or **popularity** (stars, forks, downloads).
- You can ask for **rankings**, **counts**, **comparisons**, and **filtered lists**.

## Try these

- <span class="suggestion">Show the top 20 repositories by stars</span>
- <span class="suggestion">Show repositories from UCLA with more than 100 stars</span>
- <span class="suggestion">How many repositories are there per university?</span>
- <span class="suggestion">What are the most common licenses overall?</span>
- <span class="suggestion">Show DEV projects written in Python</span>
- <span class="suggestion">List repositories with a Security Policy and Contributing guide</span>
- <span class="suggestion">Compare languages used across project types</span>

## Notes

- Results come from the dataset (not from browsing GitHub live).
- If you want, you can also use the sidebar filters and then ask questions about the filtered subset.
